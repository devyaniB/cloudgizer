# CLOUDGIZER 

Cloudgizer is a tool for building web applications as Apache modules, with emphasis on performance, small-footprint, and more productive and safer programming in C. The programmer writes simple markup language mixed with C code, which is then translated entirely into C code and compiled natively as Apache module. The resulting application is fast and takes less memory, as there are no interpreters or virtual machines. Cloudgizer works with RedHat/Centos 7 operating system, Apache web server and mariaDB database. 

Cloudgizer is Free and Open Source software distributed under Apache 2 License.
